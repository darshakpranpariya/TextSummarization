# TextSummarization

The Pegasus hugging face model is a text summarization model that uses a transformer to encode a text input into a fixed-length vector. This vector is then used to predict the summary of the input text. Moreover, the model can be fine-tuned on a specific dataset to improve its performance. This model is specially designed to work with long documents, such as news articles or books. The company hugging face is also working on a version of the model that can handle shorter texts, such as tweets. This flask project aims to provide an easy-to-use web interface for the model and convert long texts into summaries.
